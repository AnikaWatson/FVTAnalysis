##Exercises:
1. Manipulate the following function, adding/removing terms, changing coefficients etc. and plot the results to gain an intuition for polynomials.
```{r}
polynomial <- function(x) {
  0 + x + 2*x^2 + 3*x^3 +4*x^4 +5*x^5 + 6*x^6
}
```


##Practice Problems:
1. a) Open the sample dataset CatTemp1.csv representing the growth rate of Freija Fritillary caterpillars as a function of temperature and write a program that fits a polynomial to the data. (Growth rate (mg day^â€“1^))
      b) Use your program to fit a polynomial to the data in CatTemp2.csv representing the growth rate of the Stella Orange Tip as a function of temperature and compare these populations using multivariate and function-valued methods.
      c) Plot the data of both populations, and their polynomial approximations on the same graph. Does it look like there ought to be a 
    d) TroubleShooting: Iport the data into Excel and use the plotting function to fit a polynomial of bestfit to the data. Do Excel's coefficients match those you found in R?
2. Determine whether or not there is a significant diference between the datasets:
